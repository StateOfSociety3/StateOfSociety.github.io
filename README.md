This website was made by X, on the behalf of E for his art Final Major Project.

The orginal conseption of this project accutally started because I was extremely bored one friday after college. What happned is on one firday in late march I finished college at 2pm and after talking with people fopr a good half hour they went home, I tent to stick around mostly beacause I like to have a few cigs and wander around before I go home @ 4pm, but on this day I saw one of my mates you do art dossing around so I ask wether I could come into his class room and have a nosey at his FMP. After shwoing me; he was explaining to me that he was having trouble wrapping his heasd around making a website for his line of clothes for his FMP, he tryed a shopify site but it wasnt what he had in mind, at which point he turns back to me a goes: "Xav you do computing, could you make me a website?" for which I respond with: "How much time and how much money do you have?" and which came back to me with "Ive got 9 weeks and 0 money" and immdieatly said "sold."

I took this project on mostly for fun but I woundered how it would be to dev a site in the real world with a difficult client and different pressues rather just college. And thus this was done proper with design documentation, interveiws and a report docutment. Later i will link the report document to this README.

For me [the developer] this site is the best site ive every made as client expectations forced me to to learn and become a better programmer, however the presrue of meeting a dealine I could cope with but the issue was layed in the client where he took 6 out of the 9 weeks to give me some assessts, the site was complete in 2 weeks of taking on the project however I did not get any content until a week and half before his FMP but I could not touch until a few days before hand as I had my own cource work to do. 

I appolgise for the rant.

I hope you enjoy the site as I had quite a bit creating it, as you can see as I write the README at 02:52 and the exhibition where this will be on display in 16 hours.

Yours sincerly,
X

p.s I apolgise for the amount of spelling errors as i am dyslexic :)
